## Prerequisites

   in order to run the steps provided in following Quick start guide. <br><br>

   Otherwise, you can proceed with Docker images available at [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/u/wso2/), which are created using GA releases.<br><br>
 * If you wish to run the Docker Compose setup using Docker images built locally, build Docker images using Docker resources available from [here](../../dockerfiles/) and remove the `docker.wso2.com/` prefix from the `image` name in the `docker-compose.yml`. <br><br>
